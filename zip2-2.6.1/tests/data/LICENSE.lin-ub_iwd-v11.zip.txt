and is the 11th Linux version of a game mod called "Unfinished Business
for Icewind Dale". It came with the following copyright notice:

"The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong since 1998,
and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding hours by fellow fans of the game.
Modders produce their best work and players get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together.

"There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's work as your own.
The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission from the author(s).

"Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either."
